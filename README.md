# Germinal

> It's like a journal in your terminal.

Check out `:help germinal` for more documentation. All the
stuff in the plugin folder gets executed before we get to
the neovim start screen. The second folder is called lua
and it does not automatically get executed but it is 
available to the user.

## Contributing

After making changes to the help doc, run `:helptags ALL`
so Neovim can generate help tags for you.
