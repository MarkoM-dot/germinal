# Germinal

> It's like a journal in your terminal.

Germinal will allow you to write notes on the fly while in neovim. The hope is
never to introduce new syntactic features that exist in other note-taking
plugins that induce unnecessary new file formats. It should be possible to write
notes in bare markdown or a `filetype` of your choice with some degree of
configuration. This plugin will make heavy use of the editor's ability to call
custom functions on keybinds and keep things simple. Most note-takers eventually
all end up writing their notes in markdown anyway.

Check out `:help germinal` for more documentation.

After making changes to the help doc, run `:helptags ALL` so Neovim can
generate help tags for you.
